Try again in the style of Shakespeare
Here is the text re-written in the style of Shakespeare:

In Wiltshire, England dost lie a science park most grand,
Porton Down, near Porton's village and Salisbury's land,
Where two great entities of government doth dwell,
The Ministry of Defence's Defence Science, which doth excel.

For o'er a hundred years it hath been known and feared,
For secrets kept, and military arts revered,
With seven thousand acres, 'twas made to be
One of the UK's most controversial, yet great to see.

And with it, there doth also dwell a site
Of UK Health Security Agency's might,
With private, commercial science organizations too,
And still expanding, drawing more to view.

Thus, Porton Down Science Park dost stand,
A place most fit for knowledge to expand,
For those who seek research and development's call,
And wish to join the ranks of those who lead them all.
